<h3>Virgo and Ligo collaborations.</h3>

<p>
  Mainly Virgo and Ligo collaborations can be studied with the following
  questions: What is a gravitational wave? What were the black holes that
  collided and how many solar masses did they have? When were gravitational
  waves proposed?
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  First of all, in 2015, a gravitational wave called GW150914 (for the acronym
  in English of Gravitational Wave and the date, 2015-09-14) was detected,
  thanks to the merger of a binary system of two black holes 1,300 million years
  ago. years, this was detected thanks to Ligo and Virgo (a machine about 4
  miles long which detects small changes in waves), thanks to this discovery
  there were great changes in the physics and thought of the universe that was
  believed until then.
  <br />
  A curious fact of this discovery is the prediction of Einstein who said that
  something special happens when two bodies, like planets or stars, orbit each
  other. He believed that these kinds of motions could cause ripples in space.
  These ripples would spread like the ripples that occur in a pond when we throw
  a stone.
  <br />
  <br />
  These new detections have been published by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA scientific
  collaborations, in the third catalog of transient gravitational wave sources
  (GWTC-3). The Catalog is currently accompanied by two other publications,
  which focus on the cosmological and astrophysical consequences of the results.
  As soon as the signal is identified as a potential astrophysical event by the
  detector's data analysis system, and double-checked by researchers, some
  preliminary information about the location in the sky of the gravitational
  wave source and its nature is made public, almost in real time.
