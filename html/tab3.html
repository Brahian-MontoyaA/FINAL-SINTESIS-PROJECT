  Here we can see an example of how waves work in the universe and odulation on
  earth.
</p>

<p>
  What is a gravitational wave? A gravitational wave is an invisible, yet
  incredibly fast wave that occurs in space.
  <br />
  Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light (186,000 miles or 300,000
  kilometers per second).
  <br />
  These waves contract and stretch anything in their path.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  The first detection of gravitational waves was a very important event for the
  world of science. Before this, almost everything we knew about the universe
  came from the study of light waves.
  <br />
  Now we have a new way to learn about the universe: Studying gravity waves.
  <br />
  Gravitational waves will help us learn many new things about our universe. And
  we can also learn more about gravity itself.
